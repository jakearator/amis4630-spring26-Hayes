Context:

The system must be deployed to the cloud to meet milestone requirements and ensure public accessibility. 
The hosting platform must support both the React frontend and the .NET backend, as well as integrate with a relational database.

Decision:

We will deploy the application using Microsoft Azure.

- React frontend will be hosted using Azure web hosting services.

- .NET backend will be deployed to Azure App Service.

- The database will be hosted on Azure SQL Database.

Consequences:

Positive:

- Centralized cloud environment for frontend, backend, and database

- Strong compatibility with .NET

- Scalable and reliable hosting

Negative:

- Requires configuration of Azure services and environment settings

- Introduces cloud service management responsibilities
