Context: 

Buckeye Marketplace requires a web-based system that supports product browsing, shopping cart functionality, role-based login, discounts, and order processing. 
The system must separate user interface logic from backend business logic and integrate with Azure hosting.

Decision: 

We will use React for the frontend and ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET) for the backend.
React will handle the user interface, while the .NET API will manage authentication, role-based discounts, business logic, and database communication through RESTful APIs.

Consequences:

Positive: 

- Clear separation between frontend and backend

- Secure backend enforcement of role-based discounts

- Strong compatibility with Azure hosting

Negatives:

- Requires managing and integrating two separate applications
