Status:

Accepted

Context:

The system requires structured data storage to support users, roles, products, carts, orders, and order tracking. 

The data contains clear relationships (one-to-many and many-to-many), particularly between users and roles, and orders and order items.

Decision:

We will use Azure SQL Database, a relational database management system, to store application data.

The schema will support entity relationships including:

- User <--> Role (many-to-many via UserRole)

- User --> Order (one-to-many)

- Order --> OrderItem (one-to-many)

- Product --> OrderItem (one-to-many)

Consequences:

Positive:

- Strong support for relational data and structured queries

- Aligns with the ERD design

- Integrates well with .NET and Azure

Negative:

- Requires schema design and management

- Less flexible for unstructured data compared to NoSQL alternatives
