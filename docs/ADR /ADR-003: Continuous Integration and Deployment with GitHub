Context:

The project requires a reliable way to build and deploy both the frontend and backend applications to Azure. Manual deployments increase the risk of errors and inconsistencies between environments.

Decisions:

We will use GitHub Actions to implement a CI/CD pipeline.

- Code pushed to the GitHub repository will trigger automated builds.

- The React frontend and .NET backend will be automatically deployed to Azure hosting services.

Consequences:

Positive:

- Automated and consistent deployments

- Reduced manual deployment errors

- Integrated workflow within GitHub

Negative:

- Requires initial pipeline configuration

- Requires secure management of Azure credentials
