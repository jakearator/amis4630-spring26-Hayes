Relationship table (bare minimums needed for launch)

- User 1:N Cart
- Cart 1:N CartItem
- Product 1:N CartItem
- User 1:N Order
- Order 1:N OrderItem
- Product 1:N OrderItem

How the schema supports my user stories:

The ERD supports the core marketplace workflow of browsing products, adding items to a cart, and completing checkout. 

The Product, Cart, CartItem, Order, and OrderItem entities allow users to complete purchases, supporting user stories such as “As a user, I want my checkout process to be quick and easy” (#7) and “As a user, I want to receive confirmation after placing an order” (#11).

The OrderStatusHistory entity supports order tracking, aligning with “As a customer, I want to track my order status after purchase” (#8). 

Role-based functionality is handled through User, Role, UserRole, and DiscountRule, which enables automatic discounts and supports “As an OSU student, I want student discounts applied automatically” (#1).

Overall, the schema supports the prioritized launch features while remaining scalable for future enhancements.

Note: 

- The admin dashboard is supported by the existing Product and Order entities, and admin permissions are supported through User/Role relationships.
- Cloud deployment is addressed in the system architecture (Azure hosting + GitHub Actions), not the ERD, since it does not require data entities.


LLM USED: ChatGPT — Used for assistance with feature prioritization and understanding how high-level ERD relationships should connect (e.g., one-to-many vs many-to-many). FINAL DECISIONS AND CONTENT WERE CREATED AND REVIEWED BY ME.

SOME EXAMPLES OF PROMPTS USED TO GENERATE INFORMATION / TALK TO LLM FOR ASSISTANCE:

- "To my understanding.. we need a user, role, order, cart item, order item, discountrule, and orderstatus for our MVP. Do you think we need more entities for our current MVP / User story setup?"

- "Given our current entity status, many of these relationships will be a 1:N. Will there be any different relationships involved in this ERD?"

- "Double checking, a 1:N menans one record in table A can be related to MANY records in table B, but EACH record in table B can only relate to ONE record in Table A, correct?"
